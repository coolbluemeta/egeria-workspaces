# Open Metadata Archives Loading Bay

Open metadata archives are collections of open metadata types and instances
that are stored in a file with a file extension of `.omarchive`.  If you add an
open metadata archive file into this directory, the content will be loaded into
the `active-metadata-store` repository.

More information on open metadata archives can be found
[on the Egeria website](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/open-metadata-archive/).
