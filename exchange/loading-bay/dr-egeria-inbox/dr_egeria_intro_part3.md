# Adding more to the Egeria-Markdown Glossary  
 
In the first two files created the Egeria-Markdown glossary with a few terms. In the second, we added a couple of categories and then updated the existing terms to use them. In this installment, we will add a number of terms to the glossary to make it a truly useful aid for the Dr.Egeria user. Once we have added the terms, we'll discuss how we can continue to work with the terms using the `hey_egeria` commands.
