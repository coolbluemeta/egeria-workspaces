# Demonstrating updates and additions  
      
This document was derived from the processing of the file dr_egeria_intro.md; All of the Dr.Egeria statements have been preserved (including the generated attributes such as the unique GUIDs) and the explanatory text has been replaced. For tracing purposes, the Title line, showing starting with `# Results` has been kept.

In this document we will add glossary categories, update existing terms to categorize them, and add some new terms that further explain dr.egeria.  This document is being written off-line (actually on a plane) - demonstrating one of the intriguing features of dr.egeria - because its just text, it can be edited anywhere and anytime that there is a text editor. Dr.Egeria files can be emailed, sent via text message, slack or maintained in a `git` repository. It's just text with markdown annotations.

Ok, let's get started. First, we have the `Update Glossary` command below. There is nothing new we need to add at this point so we can just leave it as-is. When this document is processed it will apply updates but if there are none, It doesn't matter.

# Update Glossary  
      
## Glossary Name  
  
Egeria-Markdown  
  
## Language  
  
English  
  
## Description  
  
Glossary to describe the vocabulary of Dr.Egeria - an Egeria Markdown language to support the exchange of metadata in a  
Markdown form.  
Dr.Egeria allows users to input metadata using any text entry system that supports the entry of standard Markdown  
notation and through post-processing  
commands, validates the Egeria content and allows the requests to be sent to Egeria.  
  
## Usage  
  
1. (optional) load an example or template for the type of object from Egeria.  
2. Create a new document (perhaps from a template) and edit it, adding in the content with the Dr.Egeria controlled Markdown language.  
3. Process the document to validate and display it before you submit it, Validation may annotate your document with recommendations and potential issues.  
4. Submit the document to Egeria using the Dr.Egeria commands.  
  
## Qualified Name  
Glossary:Egeria-Markdown  
  
## GUID  
  
--- 

 Ok, now let's create a couple of glossary categories. They will be:

* **Writing Dr.Egeria Markdown** - where we describe elements of the Dr.Egeria language as terms within the category.
* **Processing Dr.Egeria Markdown** - where we describe the commands for processing Dr.Egeria.
 

Glossary categories have the following attributes:

 


| Attribute Name | Input Required? | Generated/Default? | Unique? | Notes |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Category Name | Yes | No | No | A display name (informal name). |
| Owning Glossary | Yes | No | Yes | This is the qualified name of the glossary that owns this category. |
| Description | No | No  | No | A textual description of this category |
| Qualified Name | No | Yes | Yes | The qualified name can either be provided by the user or generated. If generated, a pattern is followed. |
| GUID | No | Yes | Yes | GUIDs are always generated by Egeria. They are meant for automation, not people. |

Qualified Names can either be user specified or generated. If generated the following the form:
`{local-qualifier}:{type}:{display name}`

* Local-Qualifier is an optional string that can be useful to both disambiguate similar names and to add some local context. Local qualifiers could be set to organization names, functions, business context, etc. The settings for a local qualifier is set either by setting the environment variable `EGERIA_LOCAL_QUALIFIER` or by passing in a parameter when executing one of the Dr.Egeria enabled commands. This could also be set for a team by an Egeria administrator.
