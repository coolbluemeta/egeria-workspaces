    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pyegeria` python library provides a wide-ranging set of python functions for interacting with the Egeria runtime.  In addition there is a command level interface (CLI) for issuing commands to Egeria and widgets to display information held by Egeria. The CLI and pyegeria commands are normally called from a terminal window. However, many of the functions can also be called within a Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to calling pyegeria commands within a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensuring you have the latest level of pyegeria\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyegeria is installed in this JupyterLab environment.  However, it is advancing rapidly and it is worthwhile checking that you have the latest level.  Firstly, to upgrade the base python functions, run the following command:\n",
