    "* The Server Survey allows you to generate a high level summary of the contents of a UC server.   This is a useful to figure out what is worth cataloguing.   A regular scheduled run of this survey can show how the contents are changing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cataloguing UC allows you to run searches over the content and also, I havenâ€™t shown you this but you can perform more detailed surveys on individual resources in UC, and receive notifications from Egeria each time something changes in UC.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Notice how dynamically configurable Egeria is.  This means its actions can be coded in your pipelines or scripts.  Plus you can see the results and act on them too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Egeria is extremely scalable.  It runs on a Raspberry Pi, so it can manage sensor data at the edge.  We have shown it here in a small team setting, plus it scales to a multi-tenant cloud environment - and all of these deployments can be linked together to share metadata.  It also can be its own deployment or embedded in other projects/products.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other processes running in Egeria can augment the metadata from UC, enhancing the level of governance that can be offered.  We are going to show this in the next call.\n",
