    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Marquez](https://marquezproject.ai/) is an open source data catalog that specializes in data observability.  It is particularly relevant to the open metadata ecosystem because it supports the visualization of [Open Lineage Events](https://egeria-project.org/features/lineage-management/overview/#the-open-lineage-standard) that track data flowing through different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Marquez\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Marquez running, `egeria_workspaces` offer a docker compose script that starts up Marquez and [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).  See **[airflow-marquez-compose](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-workspaces/tree/main/compose-configs/airflow-marquez-compose)**.  This will activate a Marquez server at `host.docker.internal:5050` and a web-based UI at `localhost:3000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook creates an endpoint description of where Marquez is running and links it to the [Open Lineage API Publisher](https://egeria-project.org/features/lineage-management/overview/#egerias-open-lineage-support) connector.  This means each open lineage event either generated by Egeria, or sent to Egeria will be passed on to Marquez.\n",
