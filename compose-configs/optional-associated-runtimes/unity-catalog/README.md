# Overview
This directory contains sample Docker Compose scripts to support the deployment of Unity Catalog for experimentation,
development, and learning. When the Unity Catalog community releases official Docker images, this directory is expected to be
deprecated. For now, it is a convenience in setting up two Unity Catalogs with their companion UIs.
