# Using the Egeria-Platform-Jupyter-Compose Environment

If you are viewing this file in a Jupyter server then now you are ready to explore and use this basic Egeria environment.

If you are running Jupyter, on the left hand navigation panel you should see two folders:
* work - for your own notebooks.
* workbooks - contains some starter jupyter notebooks and demos.

These folders reside outside of the container and by default located in the `egeria-workspaces` directory that contains the scripts used to start up this environment. These locations can be changed by altering the **Docker Compose** script 
`egeria-platform-jupyter-compose.yaml` using a text editor.



For more information, please see [Egeria Docker Compose](https://egeria-project.org/education/open-metadata-labs/overview)
