# Overview
This directory contains sample Docker Compose scripts to support the deployment of Egeria for experimentation,
development, and learning. In most cases, we recommend using the **egeria-quickstart** configuration. Please see the 
[README.md](./egeria-quickstart/README.md) file.

We provide 
additional docker scripts for convenience and to show some alternative deployments.


As always, your feedback and participation are welcome.
