# Overview
This directory contains sample Docker Compose scripts to support the deployment of Egeria for experimentation,
development, and learning. In most cases, we recommend starting with the **egeria-quickstart** configuration. Please see the 
[README.md](./egeria-quickstart/README.md) file.

We provide additional docker scripts for related runtimes, and to show some alternative egeria deployments.
More details can be found in each sub-folder.

>Note: The minimum level of Egeria (egeria-platform) required is 5.2. If you have older images you should either remove these old images or modify 
 the docker compose yaml scripts to use the image tag 'stable' (referring to 5.2 production release) or a specific post 5.2 release.


As always, your feedback and participation are welcome.
